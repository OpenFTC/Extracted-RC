# Blocks Samples

This directory contains the sample projects for blocks.

## Hardware and Webcam Names

In the past, if you added a new sample or modified an existing sample, you may
have needed to modify some java code that is used to replace the device names
in the samples with the actual device names from the hardware configuration.
This is no longer necessary.
