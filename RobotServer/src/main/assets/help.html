    <p>Robot Controller logs can be downloaded from the <b>Manage</b> page.
        Examination of the logs from the Robot Controller can sometimes help diagnose problems and bugs.</p>
    <p>The <b>Blocks</b> and <b>OnBot Java</b> Programming Tools can download programs to a laptop or upload programs to the robot.
        Saving programs to a laptop (or other computer) from time to time is highly recommended.</p>

    <h1>FTC SDK API Documentation</h1>
    <p>The FTC Software Development Kit(SDK) provides Application Programming Interface(API) documentation for the various Java classes that make up the SDK.
        Classes like <b>DcMotor</b> are required for basic operation of a robot.
        Other classes like <b>VisionPortal</b> and <b>AprilTagDetection</b> are advanced API's that allow the robot to "see" using a webcam.</p>
    <p>The FTC SDK API documentation website is organized by "artifacts", which correspond to the top-level packages of the SDK.
        The <b>DcMotor</b> class can be found in the <b>RobotCore</b> artifact, which contains many useful robot operation classes.
        The <b>Vision</b> artifact contains the <b>AprilTagDetection</b> class.</p>
    <p>Some artifacts like <b>Blocks</b> and <b>OnBotJava</b> are not intended for user programs,
        they provide the Programming Tools that run on the robot.
        The <b>Tfod</b> artifact is for TensorFlow programming and it not included in the current SDK release.</p>
    <p>If the device connected to the robot is also internet connected you can click the following link to visit the FTC SDK API Documentation.
        The link will open in a new tab.</p>
