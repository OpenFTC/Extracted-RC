 * Analog sticks are represented as floats that range from -1.0 to +1.0. They will be 0.0 while at

 * <p>
 * Triggers are represented as floats that range from 0.0 to 1.0. They will be at 0.0 while at

 * The codes KEYCODE_BUTTON_SELECT and KEYCODE_BACK are both be handled as a "back" button event.
 * Older Android devices (Kit Kat) map a Logitech F310 "back" button press to a KEYCODE_BUTTON_SELECT event.
 * Newer Android devices (Marshmallow or greater) map this "back" button press to a KEYCODE_BACK event.
 * Also, the REV Robotics Gamepad (REV-31-1159) has a "select" button instead of a "back" button on the gamepad.
