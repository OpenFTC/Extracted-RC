/**
 * {@link ServoType} is an annotation with which a class or interface can be decorated in
 * order to define a new kind of servo that can be configured in the robot configuration user
 * interface.
 * <p>
 * If the servo is not connected to a REV Hub, only the flavor parameter will be applied, as
 * other servo controllers do not support setting a custom PWM range.
 * <p>
 * If the flavor is STANDARD or CONTINUOUS, this annotation can be placed on any class or interface.
 * <p>
 * If the flavor is CUSTOM, this annotation MUST implement {@link HardwareDevice} and have a
 * constructor with at least one of the following constructor signatures:
 * <ol>
 * <li>ctor(ServoControllerEx controller, int port)  -- Only used when configured on a REV Hub</li>
 * <li>ctor(ServoController controller, int port) -- Only used when configured on a CDIM</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Must be accompanied by {@link DeviceProperties} annotation
