/*
 * This OpMode illustrates how to use a video source (camera) to locate specifically colored regions
 *
 * Unlike a "color sensor" which determines the color of an object in the field of view, this "color locator"
 * will search the Region Of Interest (ROI) in a camera image, and find any "blobs" of color that match the requested color range.
 * These blobs can be further filtered and sorted to find the one most likely to be the item the user is looking for.
 *
 * To perform this function, a VisionPortal runs a ColorBlobLocatorProcessor process.
 *   The ColorBlobLocatorProcessor process is created first, and then the VisionPortal is built to use this process.
 *   The ColorBlobLocatorProcessor analyses the ROI and locates pixels that match the ColorRange to form a "mask".
 *   The matching pixels are then collected into contiguous "blobs" of pixels.  The outer boundaries of these blobs are called its "contour".
 *   For each blob, the process then creates the smallest possible rectangle "boxFit" that will fully encase the contour.
 *   The user can then call getBlobs() to retrieve the list of Blobs, where each Blob contains the contour and the boxFit data.
 *   Note: The default sort order for Blobs is ContourArea, in descending order, so the biggest contours are listed first.
 *
 * To aid the user, a colored boxFit rectangle is drawn on the camera preview to show the location of each Blob
 * The original Blob contour can also be added to the preview.  This is helpful when configuring the ColorBlobLocatorProcessor parameters.
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list

         *
         * - Focus the color locator by defining a RegionOfInterest (ROI) which you want to search.
         *     This can be the entire frame, or a sub-region defined using:
         *     1) standard image coordinates or 2) a normalized +/- 1.0 coordinate system.
         *     Use one form of the ImageRegion class to define the ROI.

         *         ImageRegion.asUnityCenterCoordinates(-0.5, 0.5, 0.5, -0.5)  50% width/height square centered on screen
         *
         * - Define which contours are included.
         *     You can get ALL the contours, or you can skip any contours that are completely inside another contour.

         *        .setContourMode(ColorBlobLocatorProcessor.ContourMode.EXTERNAL_ONLY)            // exclude contours inside other contours
         *        note: EXTERNAL_ONLY helps to avoid bright reflection spots from breaking up areas of solid color.
         *
         * - turn the display of contours ON or OFF.  Turning this on helps debugging but takes up valuable CPU time.
         *        .setDrawContours(true)
         *
         * - include any pre-processing of the image or mask before looking for Blobs.
         *     There are some extra processing you can include to improve the formation of blobs.  Using these features requires
         *     an understanding of how they may effect the final blobs.  The "pixels" argument sets the NxN kernel size.
         *        .setBlurSize(int pixels)    Blurring an image helps to provide a smooth color transition between objects, and smoother contours.
         *                                    The higher the number of pixels, the more blurred the image becomes.
         *                                    Note:  Even "pixels" values will be incremented to satisfy the "odd number" requirement.
         *                                    Blurring too much may hide smaller features.  A "pixels" size of 5 is good for a 320x240 image.
         *        .setErodeSize(int pixels)   Erosion removes floating pixels and thin lines so that only substantive objects remain.
         *                                    Erosion can grow holes inside regions, and also shrink objects.
         *                                    "pixels" in the range of 2-4 are suitable for low res images.
         *        .setDilateSize(int pixels)  Dilation makes objects more visible by filling in small holes, making lines appear thicker,
         *                                    and making filled shapes appear larger. Dilation is useful for joining broken parts of an
         *                                    object, such as when removing noise from an image.
         *                                    "pixels" in the range of 2-4 are suitable for low res images.
