This is a home for the SDK after all the AARs have been extracted. It is the base for the OpenRC refresh.

Notes:

 - Currently holds v11.0.0
 - annotations JAR replaced with gradle line
 - gson JAR replaced with gradle line (extras not published to maven/jcenter, so extras JAR still needed)
 - ~~JavaWebSocket JAR replaced with gradle line~~ (1.4.1 not on maven/jcenter yet)
 - ~~SL4J JAR omitted because aforementioned gradle line seems to pull it in~~
